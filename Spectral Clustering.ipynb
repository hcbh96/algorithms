    "# Spectral Clustering\n",
    "\n",
    "The spectrum of a matrix refers to the eigenvalues of the matrix. In spectral clustering the eigenvalues of a similarity matrix is used to perform dimensionality reduction, prior to clustering. In this tutorial we will take the reader through the construction of a similarity matrix, the construction of a Laplacian matrix, the reduction of the laplacian to its eigenvalues and how these eigenvalues can be used to cluster the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Similarity and Degree is used to construct Laplacian\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the case where we have two locations on a map $l_i, l_j$ $\\in L$, we can define a distance measure $d$ such that $\\forall l_i,l_j \\in L: d(l_i,l_j) \\mapsto {1 \\cup 0}$, dependent on whether a road directly connects $l_i$ to $l_j$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once a distance measure has been defined a similarity matrix can be constructed as a symmetric matrix $A$, where $A_{ij} \\geq 0$ represents whether $i$ and $j$ are neighboring towns.\n",
    "\n",
    "The general idea of spectral clustering is to use a regular clustering algorihtm (such as k-means) on relevant eigenvectors of a Laplacian Matrix of $A$. The question to answer next is how do we construct the Laplacian?\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have a similarity matrix $A$ we can construct a distance matrix $D$, such that $D_{ii} = \\sum_j A_{ij}$. This produces a diagonal matrix the elements of which for a given town $i$, represents the number of towns $j$ that neighbor $i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many different types of Laplacian which a few of which we shall delve deeper into later in this article. For now a __simple Laplacian__ matrix, can be constructed using the formula \n",
    "\n",
    "$$L = D - A$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Elements $L_{ii}$ represent the number of neighboring towns, and elements $L_{ij}: i\\neq j$ specify whether there is road between town $i$ and town $j$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This leaves us with our Laplacian matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Symmetric normalised Laplacian\n",
    "\n",
    "The symmetric normalised Laplacian is defined as \n",
    "\n",
    "$$L_{sym} = D^{-\\frac{1}{2}}LD^{-\\frac{1}{2}} = I - D^{-\\frac{1}{2}}AD^{-\\frac{1}{2}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Wher $L$ is the unnormalised Laplacian, $A$ is the adjacency matrix and $D$ is the degree matrix. The reciprocal square root of $D$, $D^-{\\frac{1}{2}}$ is a diagonal matrix who's entries are the positive square roots of the diagonal entries $D$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once one has $L^{sym} = SS^*$, where $S$ is the matrix with row and columns corresponding to vertices and edges repectively. Such that each column corresponding to an edge $e= \\{u, v\\}$ has an entry $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{d_u}}$ in the row corresponding to $u$, an entry $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{d_v}}$ in the row corresponding to $v$, and $0$ elsewhere.\n",
    "\n",
    "The eigenvalues of the normalised Laplacian are non-negative, and satisfy $0 = \\lambda_0 \\leq \\dots \\leq \\lambda_{n-1} \\leq 2$. These eigenvalues known as the spectrum, relate well to other graph invariants for general graphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Random Walk Normalised Laplacian\n",
    "The random walk normalised Laplacian is defined as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$L^{rw} = D^{-1}L$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case $D^{-1}$ is simply the a diagonal matrix with entries which reciprocals of the positive diagonal entries of $D$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For isolated vertices a common choice is to set the corresponding element $L^{rw}_{i,i}$ to $0$. This leads to the nice property that the multiplicity of the eigenvalue $0$ is equal tothe numebr of connected components in the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the Laplacian matrix has been constructed the eigenvalues can be calculated. Let $\\{\\lambda_0, \\dots, \\lambda_n\\}$ be an ordered set of eigenvalues such that $\\lambda_0 \\leq \\lambda_1 \\leq \\dots \\leq \\lambda_n$. As every row and column of the matrix $L$ sum to $0$, $\\lambda_0 = 0$ because the vector $\\vec{v_0}=(1,1,\\dots,1)$. \n",
    "\n",
    "The second smallest eigenvalue $\\lambda_1$ is called the \\textbf{Fiedler} value. The Fiedler value is only $> 0$ if L represents a fully connected graph. The corresponding vector called the Fiedler Vector which approximates the sparsest cut on the graph $L$. Therfore this  \n",
    "\n",
    "Clustering based on the Fiedler vector means we are clustering on a line in the $\\mathbb{R}$ space. This means we have a number of options available to define the clusters, a common choice is k-means.\n"
